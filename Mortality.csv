He sent little "" Tad,"" his son, to the library to bring a copy of the plays, and then read to me several of his favorite passages, showing genuine appreciation of the great poet. Relapsing into a sadder strain, he laid the book aside, and leaning back in his chair, said: ""There is a poem which has been a great favorite with me for years, which was first shown to me when a young man by a friend, and which I afterwards saw and cut from a newspaper, and learned by heart. I would,"" he continued, ""give a great deal to know who wrote it, but I have never been able to ascertain."" Then, half closing his eyes, he repeated to me the lines which I enclose to you.",unknown,lincoln,none,Oh! Why Should the Spirit of Mortal Be Proud?,

CA,8/1/1885,Bay State Monthly,"Boston, MA","I turn now to another phase of his nature, and recall that he had not grown up to manhood without the usual experiences of the tender pas- sion. It was while he was yet living at New Salem that his heart opened to a fair, sweet-tempered, and intelligent girl, with the romantic name of Anne Rutledge. They were engaged to be married as soon as he should be admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court. But in August, 1835, she died. Her beauty and her attractions and her early death made a very deep impres- sion upon him. We are told that he idealized her memory, and in his recol- lections of her there was a poetry of sentiment, which might possibly have been lessened, had she lived, by the prosaic realities of life. With all his love of fun and frolic, with all his wit and humor, with all his laughter and anec- dotes, Lincoln, from his youth, was a man of deep feeling. We have it on the authority of the most reliable of his biographers, that he always associated with the memory of Anne Rutledge the poem which, in his hours of despond- ency, he so often repeated:",none,lincoln,none,none,

LINCOLN'S FAVORITE POEM. / As is well-known to many persons, the exquisitely beautiful poem entitled ""Mortality,"" was an especial favorite with Mr. Lincoln, but it is not so generally understood that the poem was written by a young Scotchman, who died at 37--that age so fatal to Burnes, Byron, Motherwell, and so many other children of song. One evening in December, 1863, Mr. Lincoln repeated this poem to Colonel J. G. Wilson, then in Washington, when the latter said, ""Mr. President, you have omitted a portion of it."" ""What! It there more of it?"" responded Mr. Lincoln, with as much eagerness as did the backwoodsman in the story of the ""Arkansas Traveler. ' ""Yea, sir, two other stanzas."" and he thereupon repeated them to the great delight of the President. ""Can you tell me who wrote it?"" asked Mr. Lincoln, ""for I can't find out. Some of the papers attribute it to me."" ""It was written,"" replied the Colonel, ""by William Knox, a Scottish poet of considerable talent, who died in Edinburgh in 1825. He published several volumes of poems, and was well known to Sir Walter Scott, 'Christopher North,' of glorious memory, and to many other of the literary magnates of that day.""

While residing at New Salem he became very much attached to a prairie beauty of the name of Annie Rutledge. She is described as a blonde, with golden hair, red lips and cheeks, blue eyes, and manners and temper sweet and gentle. Lincoln was among her many suitors, and they were engaged to be married as soon as he should have finished his legal studies, but in August, 1835, she died. Her beauty and attractive character, together with her early death, made a very deep impression upon him. With all his love of fun and frolic,Lincoln, from his youth, was a person of deep feeling, and there was always mingled with his mirth, sadness. He idolized the memory of Annie Rutledge, and in his recollections of her there was a poetry of sentiment. He associated with the memory of his first love, the plaintive poem which in his hours of melancholy he so often repeated. Following are the first stanzas:",none,lincoln,none,none,
