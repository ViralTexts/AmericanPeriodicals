In point of smooth versification, and easy flowing rhythm, through which is almost heard the plaintive wail of woman's ruined honor, our knowledge of English literature brings to mind no single poem of such thrilling interest.

Her history is but the stereotyped edition of living thouaands to-day. Deceived and betrayed by some heartless scoundrel, she quit her happy home, left father and mother and loving sisters, under the subtle influence and seductive allurements of a moral assassin, for a life of shame. Having been abandoned by her seducer, the empty mockery, crimson depravity, and the significant glare of jewelled trappings, soon wearied her and rendered her life miserable, especially as her accomplished and cultured mind recognized their gilding--the sepulchre of her honor and the epitaph of every virtue. ~ We ask the sympathetic reader, as well as the cold and selfish-hearted, to read and carefully ponder over these lines. Sho tells the history of her life in the tenderest and deepest pathos. It is the keen shrill wail of a broken heart, without hope and without friends; in the dreary solitude of her cheerless chamber she wrote this matchless poem. Who can imagine the terrible anguish, the crushing agony, the hopeless despair, and utter isolation that filled her heart, and darkened and shrouded every gleam of sunshine? Every manly and noble mind must feel the deepest emotion of sympathy on reading this poem, for the gifted and brilliant genius forever unknown and lost to the world. The authoress died in the hospital at Cincinnati during a cold and stormy night, in midwinter, while the wind was howling fiercely and chaunting in mournful cadence her requiem; while the ""beautiful snow,"" in feathery crystals, pure and stainless as her own young angel life had been, drifted through the rattling window cases and covered the little table near her bed.

The origin and publication of this beautiful poem, is as follows: In the early part of the late Rebellion, one dark Saturday morning in the dead of winter, there died at the Commercial Hospital in Cincinnati, a young woman over whose head only two-and-twenty summers had passed. She had once been possessed of an enviable share of had been, as she herself says, ""flattered and sought for the charms of her face""; but alas! upon her fair brow had long been written that terrible word--prostitute! Once the pride of respectable parentage, her first wrong step was the small beginning of the ""same old story over again,"" which has been the only life-history of thousands. Highly educated and accomplished in manners, she might shone in the best socieiy. Butthe evil hour that proved her ruin was but the door from childhood : having spent a young life in disgrace and shame, the poor friendless one died the melancholy death of a broken hearted outcast. Among her personal effects was found in manuscript ""The Beautiful Snow,"" which was immediately carried to Enos B. Herd, a gentle man of culture and literary tastes, who was at that time editor of the National Union. In the columns of that paper, on the morning of the day following the girl's death, the poem appeared in print for the first time. When the paper containing the poem came out on Sunday morning, the body of the victim had not yet received burial. The attention of Thomas Buchanan Reed, one of the first American poets, was directed to the newly-published lines, who was so taken with their stirring pathos that he immediately followed the corpse to its final resting-place. Query: On the hypothesis that the manuscript without signature was found in her possession and that it appeared for the first time in the National Union, how can the several aspirants claim the honor of its production. Let them rise and explain. Below we publish the exquisite poem.",The Beautiful Snow,Cincinnati prostitute,none,

How many thousands have let their tears fall over these beautiful lines, as the touching pathos called into recollection their sad story of other and similar victims to man's wanton cruelty! In point of smooth versification, easy-flowing rhythm, through which is almost heard the plaintive wail of woman's ruined honor, our knowledge of English literature brings to mind no single poem or such thrilling sentiment as this. We have seen an article floating the rounds of the press, purporting to give the authorship of this remarkable effort ; but the writer of the statement, who Indulged his Inspiration ""amid the cool breezes of Lake Erie,"" seems really to know nothing about the true history. The writer gives Miss Dora Shaw, an actress and author of ""Out In the Rain,"" the credit and honor of this poem. This is a mistake. Dora Shaw has written some pleasant lines, but her brain never flushed that sparkling gem, ""The Beautiful Snow.""

CA,7/22/1886,Austin Weekly Statesman,"Austin, TX","Who Wrote ""Beautiful Snow."" / St. Louis Republican. / In response to the authorship of ""Beautiful Snow,"" about which there appears unaccountably to be still some controversy, the Republican reprints the following recital of the writing and the form of the verses as they first appeared in 1853. The article is taken from the Galaxy of July, 1869: THE poem entitled Beautiful Snow has now been the rounds of the periodical and newspaper press for the past four winters, and has been generally credited to a fallen actress who died in St. Louis; but some editors credit it to a young woman who died in a hospital at Cincinnati. Few persons, if any, know the history or the author of that beautiful poem, and as only a part of it is published in its annual rounds, I send you the whole poem, as originally published, with its simple history, which is as follows: In 1850, its author, William A. Sigourney, a nephew of the late Mrs. L. H. Sigourney, married a young, wealthy, and accomplished lady in New York City. They went to Europe, where they spent two years; but before they returned home, reports reached their friends that the young wife was inconstant, and, on their arrival in New York, her parents discarded her, and, being shunned by her former friends, she plunged headlong into vice and dissipation. Mr. Sigourney tried every means to induce her to leave her companions in sin, and walk in the paths of virtue. He was a kind husband, and idolized his young and beautiful wife ; but she would not heed his counsel and entreaties, but plunged deeper and deeper, until she was arrested in her career of vice and shame, and sent to the work-house as a common street-walker, from which place she was liberated by a well- known city magistrate, and for a short time lived with her husband ; but in the autumn of 1853 she went back to her old haunts, and commenced drinking to excess, until, in December of that year, she died in White street, and was found early in the morning, nearly covered with snow. She was buried in Greenwood by her husband. This is the true history of the poem which I give be low.",Beautiful Snow,William A. Sigourney,St. Louis Republican,

At one time, for somo twelve or fourteen years, ho was under contract to write four continued stories a yoar for Saturday Night, eaoh story to be over sixty columns in length. For this ho received an income of $4,000 a year and lived comfortably. Tho work, however, was not congenial to him, and aftor tho timo mentioned ho felt unable to continue under the strain.

NEW Yore, July 2S.-It has happened to many men who have worked for a long life time patiently and well that they have achieved fame by some single piece of work that seems by comparison no better than many other things they may have done, buch fortune as this seems especially to fall to literary men, and one of the most conspic ous recent examples was James ""W.

No reader of the present generation can be ignorant of the dispute that lasted for yean over the question as to who reallv wrote ""Beautiful Snow."" It was origi nally published in Harper's Weekly, in No vember, 1358. At the time of its publication limbing tho signatures of their contribu tors, and the poem appeared anonymously. It caught the popular faor, and has be come one oi il3 best known poems of American authorship, being included in various collections, such as school readers and books of recitations It is hard to tell just why it became popular, for it is not, from a literary htand point, entitled to great praise, but something in its simple direct ness made it a success. After a time several persons claimed to have written it, and for u time there was great doubt as to who the real author was, but it was at length acknowledged gener ally that Mr Watson was entitled to tho credit. Williim Cullon Bryant included tho poMn in nis famotis collection and ascriixiJ its authorshiD to Watson, and tho question raiy bo fairly con&idured settled.
